Prompt:

You are an expert project manager using Jira. I have a business document uploaded that outlines the requirements for a new project. Please read the document and create the following for me:

Epic: Summarize the main goal of the project into a single Epic. The Epic should be a high-level description of the overall work required.

User Stories: Break down the Epic into smaller, actionable User Stories. Each story should follow the format:

"As a [type of user], I want to [goal] so that [reason/benefit]."
Each story should have:
A description
Acceptance criteria (2-3 points)
Priority (High, Medium, Low)
Once you generate the Epic and User Stories, return the information in a JSON array format like this:

{
  "epic": {
    "title": "Epic Title",
    "description": "High-level description of the project goal."
  },
  "stories": [
    {
      "title": "Story Title",
      "description": "As a [type of user], I want to [goal] so that [reason/benefit].",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Acceptance criterion 1",
        "Acceptance criterion 2",
        "Acceptance criterion 3"
      ],
      "priority": "High"
    },
    {
      "title": "Story Title 2",
      "description": "As a [type of user], I want to [goal] so that [reason/benefit].",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Acceptance criterion 1",
        "Acceptance criterion 2"
      ],
      "priority": "Medium"
    }
  ]
}
